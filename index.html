					<i> A good advice before a business decision has the function of a recipe before starting to cook. They do not constrain people's freedom, but rather give them an abundance of tested information before own independent creative decisions are made.</i><br/><br/>
					Option 1 <br/>
					You invite us to an independent analysis of your business and we will look at one, two or all three of the foundation stones of your business, compare them primarily with the optimal scientific standards for the structure and the functioning of company and secondly with foundation stones of your successful competitors on the market. Our analysis then goes a step further, after you are well informed about the concrete issues of your business, as well as the objective state of affairs the sphere of the market your company is in, for we then compare your company to companies from other market spheres and cultures. This allows us to create original and innovative ideas for the expansion of your business as well as to develop solutions for the problems that burden you. You will receive the results of our analysis in the written, as well as in a verbal form during a presentation alongside which we also like to inform our customers of the full potential their company can reach.<br/><br/>
					Option 2<br/>
					We can also give you advice before important business and project decisions that involve strategy, structure and/or identity. It is in this way that we enrich you with our professional perspectives to the relevant areas that are in your business interest. Long term involvement in the business plans and decisions of our client's companies is objectively speaking far more functional for us. However in today's fast pace world of business, we are naturally prepared to guarantee our presence at all times especially when it comes to short term contracts.

					<i>Good business decisions are ultimately only good if they are executed well. </i><br/><br/>
					We are young professionals that are ready and at your disposal when it comes to the execution of any business decision involving one of the three spheres that belong to our areas of expertise. In the event that you do not have the right workforce in your team for specific projects or in the event that you want to empower your project team with other young professionals, our whole international team is ready to act upon your decisions.<br/><br/>
					Above all, after our thorough analysis of your company, we offer you to transform everything that we have identified as having the ability to boost and strengthen your company into concrete projects and independently implement these for you.

					Is the division of labour in your business really optimal? Are you pleased with the definition and tasks of all the jobs in your company? Does your every employee have enough freedom and possibility to develop him/her in the workplace? Do your employees really share the values of the company or are the just acting as if they do? Do you have an overview of your company with which you are completely satisfied? Is the management in your company really the constant that supports your employees at all times?<br/><br/><br/>

					A firm internal structure that makes the whole strong exists only when the magnetism between its components is strong. After the identification of the most important components of your company, organisational structures are set up, strategies are developed and internal norms are created or those already in place are strengthened. A functional company has all of these elements and we are here to scientifically unify organisational, psychological, historical and philosophical approaches in order to determine how effective your business structure is. With the results we can then optimize your company.

					The first step of our work is always the analysis. After an objective analysis of the achieved growth of your company, we examine your plans for future growth. We do this by using scientific methods and standards in order to compare successful strategies of the companies within your market sphere and those outside of it, as well as with successful companies from other cultures belonging to your market sphere. We can then advise you both in the improvement of the existing distribution channels as well as in the creation of new ones on the international, national and regional level, and in the strategic planning. We can also join your project teams. As international relations experts we look forward to all companies that want to strengthen their position in the foreign market or conquer new foreign markets.

				<div class='inTable1'>Are your products, your employees and your offices really leaving the desired impression on your clients and workers? Are they mostly charmed or rather frustrated?<br/><br/>
				Have you ever asked yourself about the limits of charm without an identity and with that about the limits of an identity that has no charm? We believe that both can in the long term arrive to nothing but failures and disappointments. A plain charming person lacking a concrete identity that someone can use for something is easily forgotten on the market place. A person with a very tangible identity but without any charm is on the other hand being ignored by the most for it transmits no trust, while it is being exploited by few recognising its value. The long-term goal of any business must be to combine identity and charm and we will accompany you to achieve this synthesis.

				Every business is for us an organized group of people with a goal to fulfil concrete interests. Comparatively speaking, the groups differ in interests, size, their cultural and technical composition, the infrastructure and the business network which are available to it. They also differ in their internal organisation, their division of labour, the working methods and strategies in place. And yet, even though such immense differences exist, all businesses have three foundation stones in common, for each group that strives to be effective in the fulfilment of its interests requires:

						<div class='inTable1'>In a nutshell, the liberal market economy is for us just the accepted universal method of free trade of goods and services to which the goal of "wealth" creation is central. Wealth is thereby everything that can allow someone to survive, as well as to thrive in life. In the free market (that exists all around us and in every interaction with fellow men, official or private) wealth is found in what all parties to a successful trade are left with (wealth is the profit created after a win-win situation). <!-Normatively speaking the goal of the free market for everyone should not be to create as much wealth as possible, for it doesn't do anything if it is not used up, but rather to accumulate as much as is necessary for a thriving life.-></div>
					</td>
					<td>
						<div class='inTable2'>A central problem that thwarts the working of many liberal market economies is the "people and the information chaos". Entrepreneurs as well as clients often lose their so important overview and with it their specific insights, thereby getting swallowed by the existing chaos. The decline of interpersonal trust makes it more difficult for the client to trust a company so new methods are constantly looked for and created. <!-Ultimately however it is only a loyal, proficient and expert work team, that in a transparent collaboration can create the necessary clarity that is fundamental for the overview and with it the specific insights – for the entrepreneur as well as for the clients.->

					<div>Innovation is a term whose circulation speed is exponentially increasing in our contemporary times, where there are as many definitions of the term as there are types of beverages on the market. We understand innovation as an improvement of the current state of affairs where the current state of affairs has a more important role than the improvement. An innovation should not namely be a revolution and thus mean a destruction of the current state of affairs, but rather an evolution, a gradual change. Everything functional and beneficial from the current condition should be detected and preserved with high regard until new improvements can safely be incorporated into it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
					Our innovation for consulting, as an established sphere in every healthy market economy, consists of a premise that the functional should be maintained, for only in this way advice can lead to the adoption and the execution of the necessary activities that can bring concrete benefits to companies and their clients. We offer staff, that is sophisticated, charming, loyal and that can reach every part of the world and with it we enrich the world of consulting with our strive for a long term harmony of values with our clients. It is only on the basis of common values that we can successfully create collaborative business ventures allowing for the formation of “win-win situations” that promote the life of everyone involved in them.

					We are interested in finding out what you have been able to make, achieve and create in your life so far, but it is even more important for us to know with what methods you want to make, achieve and create more.<br/><br/>

					Our application process is therefore divided into three parts:<br/><br/>
					<ol>
					<li>Your life so far - your Curriculum Vitae (10 points)</li><br/>
					<li>Your wishes - your Motivation letter (20 points)</li><br/>
					<li>Your methods - a homework assignment (70 points)</li><br/>
					</ol><br/><br/><br/>
					After we get your curriculum vitae and your motivation letter, we will send you an assignment suitable for your desired position. So you don't have to "write how you would achieve something", but you can also "demonstrate it". Only after receiving the homework assignment will we make further decisions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
